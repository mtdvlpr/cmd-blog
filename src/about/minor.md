# About the minor

I'm doing the [Web Design & Development minor](https://everythingweb.org/) at the HvA. I'm learning a lot about web development and design.

## Courses

The minor consists of five courses and a hackathon. Each course is about a different aspect of web development and design.

### [Web App From Scratch](/blog/web-app-from-scratch)

This course is about creating a web app from scratch using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### [CSS To The Rescue](/blog/css-to-the-rescue)

This course is about creating a web app using only CSS. We have to create a web app that is accessible to everyone.

### [Browser Technology](/blog/browser-technology)

This course is about creating a web app that works for everyone, no matter what browser or device they use.

### [Hackathon](/blog/hackathon)

The hackathon is a one week event focused on a specific topic. We have to create a web app that incorporates the topic.

### [Human Centered Design](/blog/human-centered-design)

This course is about creating a web app that is user-friendly. We have to do user research and usability testing.

### [API](/blog/api)

This course is about creating a web app that uses data from an external API and implements Web APIs.

## Weekly Nerd

Every week we have a guest speaker. They talk about their work and experiences. It's always interesting to hear from professionals in the field. After each talk, we write a blog post about it. You can find them on the [blog page](/blog).

## Learning Goals

During this minor, I want to learn more about web development and design. Especially about how to come up with a good design. I'd also like to improve in working with vanilla JavaScript, without frameworks.
