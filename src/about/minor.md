# About the minor

I'm doing the [Web Design & Development minor](https://everythingweb.org/) at the HvA. I'm learning a lot about web development and design.

## Courses

The minor consists of five courses and a hackathon. Each course is about a different aspect of web development and design.

### [Web App From Scratch](/blog/web-app-from-scratch)

This course is about creating a web app from scratch using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### [CSS To The Rescue](/blog/css-to-the-rescue)

This course is about creating a web app using only CSS. We have to create a web app that is accessible to everyone.

### [Browser Technology](/blog/browser-technology)

This course is about creating a web app that works for everyone, no matter what browser or device they use.

### [Hackathon](/blog/hackathon)

The hackathon is a one week event focused on a specific topic. We have to create a web app that incorporates the topic.

### [Human Centered Design](/blog/human-centered-design)

This course is about creating a web app that is user-friendly. We have to do user research and usability testing.

### [API](/blog/api)

This course is about creating a web app that uses data from an external API and implements Web APIs.

## Weekly Nerd

Every week we have a guest speaker. They talk about their work and experiences. It's always interesting to hear from professionals in the field. After each talk, we write a blog post about it. You can find them on the [blog page](/blog). My reflection on the Weekly Nerds can be found in the [Weekly Nerd blog post](/blog/weekly-nerd).

## Learning Goals for the minor

During this minor, I want to learn more about web development and design. Especially about how to come up with a good design. I'd also like to improve in working with vanilla JavaScript, without frameworks.

## Meesterproef

At the end of the minor, we have to do a meesterproef. This is a project where we have to create a web app for a real client. We have to use everything we learned during the minor. I'm looking forward to this project!

### Meesterproef Learning Goals

### Design

I'd like to improve my design skills during the meesterproef and come up with a good design for the web app. Specifically, I want to be able to come up with creative solutions to visualize functionalities. I'll work on this by brainstorming ideas, experimenting with different designs and getting feedback on them. I'll be happy if the client is happy with the design.

### Client communication

I'd also like to learn how to work with a real client. I want to be able to effectively translate the user needs to requirements and an actual product. I will try to do this by asking the right questions, listening to the client and making sure I understand their needs. I'll be happy if the client is happy with the end result.

### Server-rendered JavaScript

Furthermore, I'd like to continue working with server-rendered JavaScript and improve on my existing knowledge from the API course. I will do this by experimenting with more advanced server-rendered JavaScript functionalities and by implementing them in the web app. I'll be happy if the web app works well.
