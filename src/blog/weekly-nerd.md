## Reflection

The Weekly Nerds have been really interesting! I learned a lot about several topics. I learned about unknown HTML elements, new CSS features and accessibility. I liked Kilian's talk the most. He talked about how we should use HTML and CSS instead of JavaScript whenever possible and let the browser do the work. He showed us some built-in HTML and CSS features that I didn't know about. I will definitely use these in the future.

I also liked the talks about accessibility. I learned that more people than I thought have disabilities. I think it is very important to make websites accessible to everyone. I will definitely keep the things I learned in mind when I create websites in the future.
