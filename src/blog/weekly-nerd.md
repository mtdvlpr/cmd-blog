## Weekly Nerds

The Weekly Nerds have been really interesting! I learned a lot about several topics. I learned about unknown HTML elements, new CSS features and accessibility. I liked [Kilian's talk](/blog/polypane) the most. He talked about how we should use HTML and CSS instead of JavaScript whenever possible and let the browser do the work. He showed us some built-in HTML and CSS features that I didn't know about. I will definitely use these in the future.

I also liked the talks about accessibility. I learned that more people than I thought have disabilities. I think it is very important to make websites accessible to everyone. I will definitely keep the things I learned in mind when I create websites in the future.

The creative, artsy talks were not really my thing. I'm more of a technical person. I did learn some new things during these talks, but I didn't find them as interesting as the other talks.

## Courses

I learned a lot during the courses. I learned how to create a web app from scratch using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I learned how to create a web app using only CSS. I learned how to create a web app that works for everyone, no matter what browser or device they use. I learned how to create a web app that is user-friendly. I learned how to create a web app that uses data from an external API and implements Web APIs.

I liked the [Browser Technology](/blog/browser-technology) and [API](/blog/api) courses the most. I learned the most during these courses. I learned a lot about (browser) accessibility that I will definitely use in the future. I also learned how to implement several Web API's, which I thought was very interesting to play around with. I had never created a server-rendered web app before, so that was a nice challenge.
