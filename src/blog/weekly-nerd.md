## Weekly Nerds

The Weekly Nerds have been really interesting! I learned a lot about several topics. I learned about unknown HTML elements, new CSS features and accessibility. I liked Kilian's talk the most. He talked about how we should use HTML and CSS instead of JavaScript whenever possible and let the browser do the work. He showed us some built-in HTML and CSS features that I didn't know about. I will definitely use these in the future.

I also liked the talks about accessibility. I learned that more people than I thought have disabilities. I think it is very important to make websites accessible to everyone. I will definitely keep the things I learned in mind when I create websites in the future.

## Courses

I learned a lot during the courses. I learned how to create a web app from scratch using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I learned how to create a web app using only CSS. I learned how to create a web app that works for everyone, no matter what browser or device they use. I learned how to create a web app that is user-friendly. I learned how to create a web app that uses data from an external API and implements Web APIs.

I liked the Browser Technologies and API courses the most. I learned the most during these courses. I learned a lot about  (browser) accessibility that I will definitely use in the future. I also learned how to implement several Web API's, which I thought was very interesting to play around with. I had never created a server-rendered web app before, so that was a nice challenge.
