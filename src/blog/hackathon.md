## Assignment

For this hackathon, We had to create a unique, accessible and responsive website that incorporates the data of CSS Day of the past 10 years.

## Reflection

I liked the assignment, because we had a lot of freedom to create whatever we wanted. I learned a lot about how to work together with a team and how to divide tasks. We ended up winning the hackathon (together with another team), which was a nice bonus!
