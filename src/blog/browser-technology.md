## Summary

{{ $frontmatter.byline }}

## Assignment

For this course, I had to create a digital version of a tax form using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I had to make sure that the form is accessible to everyone and that it works on all devices, browsers and screen sizes. It should also work if CSS or JavaScript or both are disabled.

## Reflection

I liked this course a lot! I learned a lot about accessibility and how to support different browsers and older devices.
