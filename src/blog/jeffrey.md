Development ecosystem

frontend vs backend

javascript can be used for both

deployment

localhost vs server

backend and frontend have different processes to get localhost to server

toolbox workflow

Jeffrey created a toolbox to make his workflow easier.

Every animation or 3D model he creates, is saved in a toolbox to be able to use it in different projects.

try
fail or succeed
new truth
reflect

Jeffrey's way of working is about just trying things out and see if it works. Whether or not it works, he reflects on it and learns from it.

Take away's

- Create your own ecosystem
- Stick to core technologies as much as possible (TypeScript over JSX)
- Create tools that support personal workflow (templates, scripts, etc.)
- Development != Efficiency / costs
