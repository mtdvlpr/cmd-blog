# Digital Art

Speaker: Jeffrey Arts
Website: jeffreyarts.nl

## Summary

{{ $frontmatter.byline }}

## Notes

Development ecosystem

frontend vs backend

javascript can be used for both

deployment

localhost vs server

backend and frontend have different processes to get localhost to server

toolbox workflow

Jeffrey created a toolbox to make his workflow easier.

Every animation or 3D model he creates, is saved in a toolbox to be able to use it in different projects.

try
fail or succeed
new truth
reflect

Jeffrey's way of working is about just trying things out and see if it works. Whether or not it works, he reflects on it and learns from it.

Take away's

- Create your own ecosystem
- Stick to core technologies as much as possible (TypeScript over JSX)
- Create tools that support personal workflow (templates, scripts, etc.)
- Development != Efficiency / costs

## Reflection

I could not really follow Jeffrey's talk. I think it was because of the way he presented his talk. He was talking very fast and he was not very clear in his explanations. I think he could have used more structure in his talk. He was jumping from one topic to another without any clear structure. Besides this, the parts that I did follow were not very interesting to me personally. He talked more about his art than actual web technology.
