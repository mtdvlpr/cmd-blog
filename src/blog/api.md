## Summary

{{ $frontmatter.byline }}

## Assignment

For this course, I had to create a server-side rendered PWA (Progressive Web App) that uses data from an external API. I had to implement multiple Web APIs to enhance the user experience and create at least an overview and detail page.

## Reflection

I learned a lot during this project. I had never made a server-side rendered application before, so I had to learn how to render the application from Node.js. I also learned how to use Web APIs like Server Sent Events, Web Share API, Picture-in-Picture API, and Web Speech API. I really enjoyed working with these APIs and I'm looking forward to using them in future projects.
