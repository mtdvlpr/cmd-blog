## Product Biography

In the product biography, I will document the process, iterations, way of working and planning of the Meesterproef for each week. Tristan, Quinten and I will work together on the Meesterproef. We will work on the Anno Amsterdam project.

### Week 1

#### Preparation

We started the week with preparing for the briefing with the client. We went through the assignment description and created an initial MoSCoW analysis. We also created a list of questions for the client and started researching possible solutions for the assignment. The client described a native app for Android and IOS, so I immediately started researching how we could create a native app using web technologies. I found Quasar, a Vue.js framework that allows you to create a native app using Vue.js. With one code base, we could create a PWA, android app and IOS app.

We have divided the roles within the team. I will be mainly responsible for writing the notes for every meeting and discussion. Tristan will oversee the planning and make sure we stay on track. Quinten will be responsible for the contact with the client. We will all work on the design and code together.

We talked with our coach, Victor, and he encouraged us to focus on the PWA and not on creating a native app. He proposed to use Astro or SvelteKit and discouraged using React. He was not against Vue/Nuxt, because Vue is much closer to the Browser APIs than React and is not included in the build output.

#### Briefing

During the briefing, we asked the client all our questions and got a better understanding of the assignment. The client was very open and gave us a lot of information. We convinced him that a PWA would be a better solution than a native app. We discussed our MoSCoW analysis and adjusted it based on the client's feedback. We also discussed the clickable prototype that was created by the client. We decided to use the prototype as a reference and not as a final design and the client agreed. The client showed us the "backoffice" that was created by other students. It is a CMS to store the different buildings. The client told us that one of the students that created the "backoffice" is still available for questions, so we contacted him and set up an online meeting for the very next day.
