# CSS & Art

Speaker: Julia Miocene

## Summary

{{ $frontmatter.byline }}

## Notes

How to create a character with CSS:

- Create a bunch of div's
- Change the border-radius
- Nest everything (arms in body, fingers in arms, etc.)
- Overlap 2 parts and set the transform-origin to the joint
- Make the div's rotate and translate

## Reflection

I don't think I'll ever use this in a project, but it was fun to see how creative you can be with CSS. It's also a good way to learn more about CSS animations and transforms.
