Speaker: Marieke de Hoop & Pim Teeuwisse

## Summary

{{ $frontmatter.byline }}

## Notes

Besides permanent disabilities, there are also a lot of situational and temporary disabilities. For example, when you break your arm, you can't use your mouse. Or when you're in a loud environment, you can't hear the audio.

WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) is a set of guidelines to make websites accessible. There are about 50 criteria and 4 main principles:

- Perceivable
- Operable
- Understandable
- Robust

"The big 4" are what Marieke & Pim find most important. These are the most common issues they see in websites.

Audio Control

Audio should be able to be paused or stopped. It should also be possible to adjust the volume. This is important for people who are hard of hearing or deaf, but also for people who are sensitive to sound.

No Keyboard Trap

When you're using a keyboard to navigate a website, you should be able to navigate back to where you started. This is important for people who can't use a mouse.

Pause, Stop, Hide

All moving, flashing, scrolling or actualizing content should be able to be paused, stopped or hidden. This is important for people who are sensitive to motion or light.

Three Flashes or Below Threshold

Flashes should be below a certain threshold. This is important for people who have epilepsy. Website should never flash more than 3 times per second.

Questions to ask yourself:

- Can this content be perceivable by everyone? (color contrast, alt text, etc.)
- Can this content be operated by everyone? (keyboard navigation, timers, etc.)
- Can this content be understood by everyone? (language, error messages, jargon, etc.)
- Is the technology used robust enough? (Semantic HTML, ARIA, etc.)

Use a screenreader. Use your keyboard. Test with your target audience.

## Reflection

I think it's important to make websites accessible to everyone. It's not that hard to make a website accessible, but it's often overlooked. I think it's good that there are companies like Digitaal toegankelijk that help other companies make their websites accessible. I think it's important to test websites with your target audience. You can't know if a website is accessible if you don't test it.
