Speaker: Rosa Schuurman

## Summary

{{ $frontmatter.byline }}

## Notes

Worked as digital creative

circuit bending

- circuit bending is the creative short-circuiting of electronic devices such as low voltage, battery-powered guitar effects, children's toys and small digital synthesizers to create new musical or visual instruments and sound generators.
- Trying to create something new with existing technology.
- Started in 70s
- gives workshops

rules

- battery only
- use your eyes, ears, hands, nose and brains
- look for short circuits
- mark your findings
- create an interaction

kinda like inspect element but with hardware

conclusion: don't accept the status quo

## Reflection

It was interesting to see how Rosa uses technology in a creative way. I never heard of circuit bending before, but it seems like a fun way to create new things. I don't think I'll ever do it myself, but I'm glad I know about it now. I did like the conclusion: don't accept the status quo. It's important to keep looking for new ways to do things.
