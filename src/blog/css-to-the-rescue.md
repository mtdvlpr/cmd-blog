## Assignments

There were two assignments during this course. An individual one and a team one.

### Individual assignment

For this course, I had to create a cool, interactive website using only CSS. I had to experiment with new(ish) CSS features. I chose to create a Pacman game using only CSS.

### Team assignment

For the team assignment, I had to work together with a team to experiment with new(ish) CSS features related to colors and present the results to our classmates.

## Reflection

This course was definitely a challenge for me. I had never experimented with CSS like this before and I always struggle to come up with original ideas. I did learn a lot about new(ish) CSS features and how to use them. I also learned that CSS can be very powerful and that you can create cool, interactive websites without using JavaScript.
